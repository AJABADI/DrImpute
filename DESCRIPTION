Title: Imputing dropout events in single-cell RNA-sequencing data.
Description: R codes for imputing dropout events. Many statistical methods in cell type identification, visualization and lineage reconstruction do not account for dropout events ('PCAreduce', 'SC3', 'PCA', 't-SNE', 'Monocle', 'TSCAN', etc). 'SCimpute' can improve the performance of such software by bimputing dropout events.
